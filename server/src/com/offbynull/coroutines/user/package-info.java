/**
 * User-level classes for coroutines. The entry-point of your coroutine should be a class that implements
 * {@link com.offbynull.coroutines.user.Coroutine}. To run your coroutine, use {@link com.offbynull.coroutines.user.CoroutineRunner}.
 * <p>
 * A simple example of a coroutine:
 * <pre>
 * import com.offbynull.coroutines.user.Continuation;
 * import com.offbynull.coroutines.user.Coroutine;
 * 
 * public class SimpleTest implements Coroutine {
 * 
 *     public void run(Continuation c) {
 *         System.out.println("started");
 *         for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
 *             echo(c, i);
 *         }
 *     }
 * 
 *     private void echo(Continuation c, int x) {
 *         System.out.println(x);
 *         c.suspend();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
